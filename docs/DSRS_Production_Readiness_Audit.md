# DSRS Production Readiness Audit (Current Status)

This document summarizes the DSRS systemâ€™s deployment readiness as of this commit. It compares the current implementation against the earlier audit (docs/DSRS_Implementation_Audit.md), highlights what has been completed since Phase 1 fixes, identifies remaining critical gaps, and recommends final hardening steps.

## Completed Since Phase 1

- Atomic outbox transactions for Registry POST/PUT
  - Outbox inserts occur in the same DB transaction as the business write to prevent lost events
  - Benefit: Strong consistency between writes and emitted events

- OSS observability stack
  - OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, and Grafana (compose + K8s)
  - Metrics exposed from services; events counters and service-specific histograms
  - Benefit: Real-time visibility, dashboards, and capacity for alerting

- DLQ reprocessor with hardening
  - Background worker consumes *.dlq topics, retries with backoff
  - Added Prometheus metrics (processed, retry success/fail, duration), health endpoints, and K8s probes
  - Alert rules examples provided (backlog high, retry failures, reprocessor down)
  - Benefit: Resilience for event-processing failures, operational visibility

- Real health probes
  - Liveness/readiness endpoints per service; readiness checks validate DB/Kafka/Mongo
  - Kubernetes Deployments wired with probes
  - Benefit: Operational safety (K8s only routes traffic to healthy pods)

- Analytics real-time integration
  - /api/v1/analytics/summary returns live counters from Mongo updated by event consumer
  - Test added
  - Benefit: Real-time operational metrics for dashboards and stakeholders

## Remaining Critical Gaps

- Security enforcement at the edge (OSS-only)
  - Kong: Enterprise OIDC removed; community JWT plugin (or minimal JWT filter) can provide lightweight checks, but primary enforcement is service-side JWKS
  - Need a confirmed, tested configuration for staging/prod with:
    - No ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL
    - Services enforcing JWT/JWKS (issuer/audience) without gaps
    - Optional: Kong community JWT plugin configuration to reject obviously malformed/expired tokens at edge
  - Risk: Without tested edge checks, malformed tokens may reach services; service-side enforcement mitigates but edge defense-in-depth is preferred

- Kubernetes production hardening
  - Missing or partial: External Secrets integration, NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default), PodSecurity standards, HPAs, PDBs, resource requests/limits
  - Need GitOps pipeline and/or Helm charts for consistent promotion across envs
  - Risk: Operational fragility, security exposure, and scalability constraints

- Observability completeness in K8s
  - Need kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus Operator) for CRD-based rules, ServiceMonitors, and elastic scaling
  - Need Kafka consumer lag exporter (e.g., Burrow/kafka-lag-exporter) to power backlog alerts
  - Risk: Alerts may be incomplete; on-call visibility gaps

- Testing maturity
  - E2E tests exist but can be extended for:
    - Idempotency validation, DLQ scenarios, and retries with bounded timeouts
    - Health/readiness probe behavior under dependency failures
    - Load/performance tests (baseline throughput/latency)
  - Risk: Regressions and edge-case failures in production

- API completeness
  - Registry: search/filter/pagination, detailed read endpoints
  - Eligibility/Payment: read/detail endpoints
  - Analytics: breakdowns/time-series endpoints (optional)
  - Risk: Operational usability and integration with downstream consumers

## Security Posture Assessment

- Service-level JWT/JWKS
  - Implemented via dsrs_common.security (issuer/audience validation)
  - Ensure staging/prod overlays never include ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL

- Kong (OSS)
  - Provides CORS, rate limiting, and request-size limits
  - Community JWT plugin can be configured to reject missing/expired tokens at the edge (defense-in-depth)

- Secrets
  - Currently from env/ConfigMap/Secret; recommend External Secrets (e.g., ESO) and rotation

- Network
  - Recommend NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default), mTLS via service mesh (if/when introduced with OSS Istio)

## Infrastructure Completeness

- K8s manifests present for all core services, Kong, OTEL Collector, Grafana, DLQ reprocessor, and Strimzi (Kafka)
- Overlays include important components but lack:
  - NetworkPolicies, resource requests/limits, HPAs, PDBs
  - Prometheus Operator stack and ServiceMonitors
  - GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) or CI deploy pipeline

## Testing Coverage (Critical Paths)

- Unit tests present; e2e saga tests exist with testcontainers
- Missing or can be improved:
  - E2E idempotency and DLQ retry verification across services
  - Probe behavior tests (simulate Kafka/DB down)
  - Load/performance baseline

## Top 5 Remaining Production Blockers

1. Edge security enforcement (OSS): configure and validate Kong community JWT plugin against Keycloak JWKS; ensure services enforce JWT/JWKS; confirm no bypass in non-dev
2. K8s security and reliability hardening: NetworkPolicies, resource requests/limits, HPAs, PDBs, PodSecurity levels; External Secrets integration for credentials
3. Observability in K8s with Prometheus Operator: ServiceMonitors, PrometheusRule CRDs; add Kafka lag exporter; wire dashboards/alerts
4. CI/CD pipeline for deployment: image build/push and environment promotion (OSS actions + Helm/Kustomize), GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) for drift management
5. Testing maturity: add e2e idempotency/DLQ tests, probe failure simulations, and basic perf testing

## Recommendations for Final Hardening (OSS-only)

- Security
  - Configure Kong community JWT plugin (free) to enforce exp/iss/aud; continue service-side JWKS as source of truth
  - Add route-level rate limits by sensitivity; keep /healthz open (GET only)
  - Add NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default + allow per-namespace/service)

- Reliability & Scalability
  - Add resource requests/limits, HPAs for core services, PDBs for safe rollouts
  - External Secrets Operator for Secret management

- Observability
  - Install kube-prometheus-stack; convert alert_rules.yml to PrometheusRule CRDs
  - Add ServiceMonitors for each service and DLQ reprocessor; deploy Kafka lag exporter
  - Extend Grafana dashboards (DLQ, consumer lag, error rates)

- Testing
  - Add tests for idempotency, DLQ replay, and probe behavior (Kafka/DB outages)
  - Add performance smoke test (e.g., k6 or vegeta) with CI threshold gates

## Deployment Verification Checklist (Staging/Prod)

- [ ] Kong gateway responds and enforces JWT checks (rejects missing/expired tokens)
- [ ] All services pass /healthz/readiness under normal conditions
- [ ] Readiness fails properly when Kafka/DB/Mongo is unavailable
- [ ] DLQ reprocessor healthy and exporting metrics; DLQ alerts firing on induced failures
- [ ] Prometheus Operator running; ServiceMonitors/PrometheusRules applied; alerts visible
- [ ] Grafana dashboards show live counters and DLQ metrics; Kafka lag panels operational
- [ ] NetworkPolicies applied; only necessary traffic allowed; external exposure via Kong only
- [ ] External Secrets Operator supplying Secrets; no plaintext secrets in manifests
- [ ] HPAs scaling under test load; PDBs allow safe node maintenance
- [ ] E2E saga test passes in staging; idempotency & DLQ scenarios validated; performance baseline met
