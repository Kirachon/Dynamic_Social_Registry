# DSRS Development Handoff

This handoff summarizes the current DSRS system state, remaining work for production readiness, and practical steps to run and verify the platform. It is designed to enable seamless continuation of development in future sessions.

## 1) Current Implementation Status

Completed (Phase 1 + subsequent enhancements):
- Atomic outbox transactions (Registry)
  - POST/PUT household writes and outbox inserts occur in the same DB transaction
- OSS Observability Stack
  - OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana (compose + K8s), service metrics and spans
- DLQ Reprocessor (with operational hardening)
  - Consumes from *.dlq, retries to main topics with backoff; Prometheus metrics, health server, and K8s probes
- Real Health Checks & Probes
  - Liveness/Readiness endpoints validate DB, Kafka, and Mongo connectivity; K8s Deployments wired with probes
- Analytics Real-time Integration
  - /api/v1/analytics/summary returns live counters from Mongo (assessed/approved/payments scheduled/completed)
- Event-driven Saga (choreography)
  - Topics: registry.household, eligibility.assessed, payment.events
  - Outbox pattern, idempotent consumers, DLQ publishing, header-based trace propagation

## 2) Production Readiness Assessment (Summary)

Reference: docs/DSRS_Production_Readiness_Audit.md

Top 5 remaining blockers (with priorities):
1. Edge security enforcement (OSS) — Critical
   - Configure and validate Kong community JWT plugin; ensure service-side JWT/JWKS enforcement; no insecure bypass
2. Kubernetes hardening — Critical/High
   - NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default), External Secrets, resource requests/limits, HPAs, PDBs, PodSecurity standards
3. Observability completion in K8s — High
   - Prometheus Operator (kube-prometheus-stack), ServiceMonitors, PrometheusRule CRDs, Kafka consumer lag exporter
4. CI/CD pipeline — High
   - Build/push images; Kustomize/Helm deploy; GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) for drift-free promotions
5. Testing maturity — High
   - E2E idempotency/DLQ scenarios, probe failure simulations, basic performance baseline

Operational benefits already in place:
- Stronger consistency (atomic outbox), resilience (DLQ), visibility (metrics+tracing), and operability (probes)

## 3) Next Development Priorities (Ordered)

1) Security enforcement validation (OSS-only)
- Add/validate Kong community JWT plugin configuration (exp/iss/aud) as edge guard
- Keep service-side JWT/JWKS as authority; ensure staging/prod overlays never enable insecure bypass

2) Kubernetes hardening
- NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default; allow only necessary paths)
- External Secrets Operator; remove plaintext secrets from manifests
- Resource requests/limits, HPAs per service, PDBs for safe maintenance

3) Observability completion
- Install Prometheus Operator; convert alert_rules.yml to PrometheusRule CRDs
- Add ServiceMonitors for all services and DLQ reprocessor
- Deploy Kafka consumer lag exporter; extend Grafana dashboards (DLQ + lag + errors)

4) CI/CD pipeline
- GitHub Actions build/publish images; environment promotion via Kustomize/Helm
- (Optional) GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) for declarative environment sync

5) Testing maturity improvements
- Add e2e tests for idempotency and DLQ retry behavior; probe failure simulations (Kafka/DB outages)
- Add a simple perf smoke test (k6/vegeta) with threshold gates in CI

## 4) Technical Context (Key Decisions)

- OSS-only constraints
  - No paid APIs or enterprise-only features; all security/observability via open-source components
- Architecture: Event-driven saga (choreography)
  - Registry → Eligibility → Payment via Kafka topics; outbox pattern for atomic emit; idempotent consumers; DLQ
- Authentication
  - Service-side JWT/JWKS enforcement (issuer/audience) as authority
  - Kong provides CORS, rate-limiting, size limits; community JWT plugin recommended as edge guard (no enterprise OIDC)
- Observability
  - OTEL spans for produce/consume; metrics for event flows and DLQ; Grafana dashboards and alert rules
- Kubernetes
  - Kustomize overlays for envs; Strimzi Kafka; Kong; OTEL Collector; Grafana; DLQ reprocessor

## 5) Quick Start Instructions

Run locally (compose):
```bash
# Start services and infra
docker compose up -d postgres mongo redis identity registry eligibility payment analytics kong redpanda otel-collector prometheus
# (Optional) Grafana (OSS dashboard)
docker compose -f infra/otel/docker-compose.otel.yaml up -d grafana

# Apply DB migrations
(cd services/registry && alembic upgrade head)
(cd services/eligibility && alembic upgrade head)
(cd services/payment && alembic upgrade head)

# Verify health
curl -i http://localhost:8002/healthz/readiness  # registry
curl -i http://localhost:8003/healthz/readiness  # eligibility
curl -i http://localhost:8004/healthz/readiness  # payment
curl -i http://localhost:8005/healthz/readiness  # analytics

# Trigger saga via Registry
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/v1/households \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"H1","household_number":"HH-0001","region_code":"NCR","pmt_score":0.2,"status":"Active"}'

# Observe outcomes
curl http://localhost:8004/api/v1/payments           # payment list shows Scheduled → Completed
curl http://localhost:8005/api/v1/analytics/summary  # live counters from Mongo

# Observability (local)
open http://localhost:9090     # Prometheus
open http://localhost:3001     # Grafana (anonymous viewer)
```

Run e2e tests (selected):
```bash
# Example e2e saga
pytest -q services/tests_e2e -k full_saga_end_to_end
# DLQ reprocessor unit test
pytest -q services/shared/tests/test_dlq_reprocessor.py
```

Kubernetes (staging):
```bash
# Apply core infra
kubectl -n dsrs-staging apply -f infra/k8s/otel-collector.yaml
kubectl -n dsrs-staging apply -f infra/k8s/grafana.yaml

# Apply overlay (ensure dsrs-config and dsrs-secrets are created)
kubectl -n dsrs-staging apply -k infra/kustomize/overlays/staging

# Verify probes/health
tkubectl -n dsrs-staging get pods -w
kubectl -n dsrs-staging port-forward svc/analytics 8085:80 &
curl -i http://localhost:8085/healthz/readiness
```

## 6) Branch Status
