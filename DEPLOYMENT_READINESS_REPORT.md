## ðŸ”§ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Kubernetes cluster (1.25+)
2. Strimzi Kafka operator
3. External Secrets operator
4. Prometheus operator
5. Grafana for observability

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Apply Strimzi and dependencies
kubectl apply -f infra/strimzi/

# Deploy DSRS to staging
kubectl apply -k infra/kustomize/overlays/staging/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n dsrs-staging
kubectl get services -n dsrs-staging
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Apply production configuration
kubectl apply -k infra/kustomize/overlays/production/

# Verify all services are healthy
kubectl get pods -n dsrs-production
kubectl logs -f deployment/registry -n dsrs-production
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
TESTING=1 OTEL_ENABLE=0 python -m pytest services/tests_e2e -v

# Run deployment validation
python scripts/validate-deployment.py staging

# Run smoke tests (after deployment)
python scripts/smoke-test.py --base-url http://your-staging-url
```
